I am a recent Statistics/Data science graduate from the School of Mathematics & Statistics (https://ms.unimelb.edu.au/), University of Melbourne (https://www.unimelb.edu.au/). My research interest includes Spatial Statistics, Spatio-temporal Process, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Multivariate Statistics,  Computational Statstics, Measurement Error, and Astronomy. 

I was advised by Dr.Tingjin Chu (School of Mathematics & Statistics, Unimelb) for my master's thesis (Geostatistical Analysis of Metallicity in Galaxy NGC5236).
